# 🔍 Whoami

I love building security tools that actually *work* for people instead of working against them.

## 🚀 What I’m building

I’m developing a **Scalable Plug-and-play Auto Detection Engine** that bridges the gap between heavy scanners like Nessus and autoenum scripts. 

It’s modular, efficient, and made with real users in mind — because automation shouldn’t mean losing control nor should it force you to dig through a random code base to make a small change.

### 🔧 Features you’ll love:  
🧬 Intelligent detection of systems and services  
🔗 Seamless integration with external tools  
🧩 Easy-to-extend modular architecture  
📄 Clear, verbose logging — no black boxes here  
🤖 Optional AI Assistance

## ⚙️  Why “End User First”?

Cybersecurity tools often forget one thing — *you*. I build with transparency and control front and center, so you always know what’s happening under the hood. No surprise scripts, just smart, reliable help to make your pentesting life easier.
